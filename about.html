              <p>
                We are <b>Mao</b>, a charity organisation that helps cats around
                Europe. Our shelter provides rescued cats all the attention and
                care they need to live a happy life. We started as a small team,
                motivated by creating a safe environment for cats. At the
                current moment we activate in multiple countries around Europe,
                and with help from caring people we can continue growing and
                doing our work.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started our journey in 2017, with a small team of 7 people.
                Over time our team grew and we crossed the borders. We now have
                associates in multiple cities from Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine,
                Hungary, Austria, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Poland, and
                Czech Republic. We constantly provide food, shelter, and
                treatments for cats in need. We also offer cats for adoption,
                and always provide the most simple way for you to help them.

              <p>
                We are motivated to help stray cats because we believe in giving
                these vulnerable creatures a better quality of life. Seeing them
                in distress and suffering drives us to take action and provide
                them with food, shelter, and medical care. The satisfaction of
                knowing that we can make a difference in their lives and give
                them a chance at a happier and healthier future is truly
                rewarding and keeps us committed to helping them however we can.

              <p>
                Helping stray cats can make the world a better place by reducing
                their suffering and improving their quality of life. By
                providing them with food, shelter, and medical care, we can save
                them from starvation, illness, and injury. In doing so, we also
                prevent overpopulation, reduce the spread of diseases, and
                promote a sense of compassion in our communities. Ultimately,
                creating a safer and more humane environment for all living
                beings.

              <!-- text generaterd with https://deepai.org/chat/text-generator -->
              <p>
                The future of helping stray cats looks promising as more
                organizations and individuals are becoming active in rescuing,
                fostering, and finding homes for these animals. With
                advancements in technology, such as social media platforms and
                online fundraising tools, awareness and support for stray cat
                populations are increasing. Additionally, there is a growing
                trend towards trap-neuter-return programs to control the
                overpopulation of strays and improve their quality of life.
                Overall, with continued efforts and a community-driven approach,
                the future of helping stray cats seems hopeful in finding
                sustainable solutions for their welfare.

                <b>A: </b>
                Sure! Some cats we have grew up getting in contact with other
                cats and they are very friendly and curious. If your cat also
                accepts another cat then there is no problem. You have also the
                option to schedule a visit at our centre and bring your cat as
                well. This is the best way to check if they will get along well.

                <b>A: </b>
                We recommend that you know all the time where your cat is. Cats
                that live outside the home can run away or get in trouble with
                other cats or animals. This is why we don't recommend letting
                your cat stay outside without supervision from you. You can
                learn your cat to wear a leash and go for a walk outside
                together. If you have any question about this, please
                <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and we will do our best to
                help you with advice.
